m3 - Mobile Mind Mapper is a free and open source mind mapping tool for 
mobile devices, similar to two of my favorite desktop tools: Freemind and 
Freeplane. It currently reads and displays almost all features of Freemind 
mind maps, and has rudimentary editing capabilities.

m3 runs fully in your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), thus no installation 
is required--just go to it's [page](http://glenreesor.ca/m3). When you save 
your map, it's saved on your device by your browser. If you're using Chrome, 
you can add an icon to your home screen, and it will look and behave like 
a "real" app on your device.

Although the goal is a mind mapping tool that runs on mobile devices, m3 
also works on desktops, since it's built using regular web technologies 
(HTML, javascript, css, svg).

It has been tested and works on:

    Desktop Firefox 40+
    Android Firefox 40+
    Android Chrome 47+
    Mobile Safari iOS 9.1+

m3 is in the early stages of development, however it is usable for viewing
complicated maps created by Freemind or Freeplane, or creating your own
basic maps.

Feedback is welcome.
