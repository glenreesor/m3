[m3 - Mobile Mind Mapper](http://glenreesor.ca/m3) is a mind mapping program
that runs on any device that has a web browser. It uses appcache technology that
allows you to run it and access all of your mind maps even without a network
connection.

Because m3 runs in your browser, it can be used on all platforms, including
Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, and Linux.

m3 is in the early stages of development, however it can be used for viewing
complicated maps created by Freemind and Freeplane, or creating your own basic maps.

Feedback is welcome.
