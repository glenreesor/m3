m3 - Mobile Mind Mapper is a mind mapping program originally intended
to be used in web browsers, and thus is compatible with multiple platforms
(Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, etc). That version could read and
write moderately complicated
[Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Home) mind maps,
however the architecture wasn't scalable (this was my first app using
web technology :smile:), and it became clear that the risk of deleting
your mind maps (since they reside "within" the web browser) was too
great.

A new version of m3 is being developed which will address the above
shortcomings and more. The
[old version](http://glenreesor.ca/m3) will remain available while the
new one is being developed, however expect the old one to eventually
stop working.

You may want to try out the [new version](https://glenreesor.ca/projects/m3-demo),
but keep in mind it's still very much a work-in-progress, things may change
(including the file format, which could make your data unretrievable), and will
not work offline.
